Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, developing, implementing and designing a software. 
impacts: 1.it aids in business productivity. 2. Ensures tha t the software is reliable, scalable and efficient. 3. It promotes collaboration hence good team work.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Birth of Computing- this is where there were software crises and during the NATO Conference they came up with the term software engineering, which was supposed to apply engineer principles to develop software.
2. Rise of structured programming- The creation of programming languages like C and the development of basic software engineering concepts. Develpoed by Edsger Dijkstra and Niklaus Wirth.
3. Emergence of Agile development- Came up with a linear approach where each phase was completed sequentially.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement- phase where all the necessary tools are required and what the software will do.
2. designing- Planning the architecture and design of the software.
4.Implementation- Writing down the actual code to develop the software
5. Testing- Ensuring the software works as expected and finding bugs.
6. Deployment- Releasing the software to users.
7. Maintainance-Updating and fixing issues after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterdfall- A sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It’s ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, like highly structured projects (e.g., government software). Example: Waterfall might be suitable for creating a banking system with strict compliance
Agile- An iterative and incremental approach where development is broken into cycles. Agile is great for projects where requirements can evolve, such as web or mobile app development, because it allows for flexibility and constant feedback. Agile would work well for a startup launching an app with frequent feature updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- designing, implementing and maintaining a software
A quality Assurance Engineer- tests the software to ensure it’s bug-free and meets the requirements. They write test cases and automate testing.
A project manager-Oversees the project, managing timelines, resources, and communication. Ensures the project stays on track and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs it provides developers with code editing, debugging, and compiling capabilities. e.g Visual code
VCS- Track changes to the code, enabling collaboration among team members and rollback to earlier versions if necessary. E.g GIT
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging -locating and fixing errors in large, complex codebases.
2. Changing requirements- Adapting to frequent changes in client specifications or business needs.
3. Time constraints- Balancing quality and deadlines.
   STRATEGIES.
   1. Communicating with stakeholders to set realistic expectations.
   2. Implementing automated testing to catch bugs earlier.
   3. Allow team work collaboration to beat the deadline.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a program in isolation. It ensures that each unit of the software performs as expected. And prevents small bugs.
Integraion- This tests how different modules or components of a system interact with each other.It ensures that integrated parts work together as expected.
System testing- It evaluates the complete, fully integrated software system to ensure it meets requirements.It tests the entire system’s functionality, performance, security, and compatibility. It is used by QA testers using both manual and automated methods. It ensures the software works as a whole.
Acceptance- It determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.It's used by clients, business stakeholders to ensure the software meets user's expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 It refers to the process of designing and structuring inputs given to AI models to get the most accurate and relevant responses. It’s important because how you phrase a prompt can significantly affect the quality of the AI’s output. Clear and specific prompts lead to more effective results

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"What is coding". Improved promt: "Define what is coding in a simpler term" THis prompt will give a clear and an easier explanation of what coding entails.
